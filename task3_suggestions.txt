# Task 3-Code Improvements

These are my suggested improvements for the Inventory Management application:


1.** Introduce a Service Interface**
  -Extract ProductService into an interface for testability and flexibility.
  
2.** Use Enum for Availability
  -Replace String field availability with enum availability { IN_STOCk,OUT_OF_STOCk} to avoid invalid values.

3.**Add unit test cases**
  -Add JUnit tests for filtering logic and duplicate removal to ensure data accuracy.
  
4.**Move Logic to Utility Class**
  -Move  filtering and duplication logic into a helper class to improve code readability and maintainability.
  
5.**Enhance Swagger Documentation**
  -Use @Parameter,@Tag and better examples in swagger to imporve API clarity.
  
6.**Refactor Controller**
  -Move any growing logic in controller(like filtering )into the service layer for better separation of concerns.
